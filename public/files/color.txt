Diesel
Spring/Summer 13 Campaign
Denim
Men

* Established on the production of designer jeans, Diesel has, like all clothing companies, expanded to become a "lifestyle brand" that occupies a space equidistant from Kohl's and Burberry (Burberry sells like $7000 coats). Diesel jeans have an MSRP of like $250, but they're marketed toward young adults and twenty-somethings who want to, I don't know, "live life" or whatever. Most clothiers market their image around looking better, which Diesel does, but there is also this component about being successful yet still knowing how to have a good time.

Vinci
Italian Cuisine


* Vinci is kind of an interesting Italian restaurant--they're not super-American like a fast-food Italian place, franchised like Olive Garden, or upscale like Pensiero or Trattoria No. 47, yet they have a distinctly progressive and modern take on classic Italian recipes. Like, I had a "spring risotto" there once that had, I think, fruit in it, which is not something you usually find in a hearty & robust dish like risotto. It was interesting.
