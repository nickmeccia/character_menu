       TypographyÂ®."]
    [:p "DESCRIPTION: Create a series of webpages with the content below.
       Each section of text should be a separate page. Create an index
       page to link to each. You are going to have to read the content
       of each section and make decisions. There are all sorts of
       headers and subheaders and links and lists and even a pull-quote.
       With the exception of links, I have added no HTML so that you
       must make all decisions of hierarchy on your own."]
    [:p "  RESTRICTIONS:
       * Greyscale only; no color allowed.
       * Manipulate hierarchy using only:
         * Size
           * Proximity
             * Value
             * You are allowed to add (or remove) italics, bold,
             * underline, all-caps
             * All pages should be:
               * Comfortably readable
                 * Obvious in their hierarchy
                 * A hint: not all of these sections should have the
                 * same width."]

                 * 6 pages, one for each section of content below
