It is up to you to determine the order of importance of the different sections and use hierarchy of layout and typography to make your choices apparent to the reader. You are also encouraged to decide how to capitalize, punctuate, and linkify content, even if the links don't actually go anywhere. Add and remove headers: does \"links\" need a header that say \"links?\" It's up to you. The presentation of the text purposefully obfuscates the actual implementation of the content."]
